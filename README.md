B.F. Maier's FB friends network
-------------------------------

This is the data of my anonymized Facebook friend network, collected in fall 2014. The node B.F. Maier, who is connected to every other node, has been removed.

Nodes represent Facebook profiles, edges represent Facebook friendships between the profiles.

In the `graphml`-file, nodes have additional context descriptors to categorize from which context I know the person.

Some data
```
    undirected = True
    N_nodes = 362
    N_edges = 1988
    mean_degree = 10.98
    connected_components = 20
    N_nodes_largest_component = 329
